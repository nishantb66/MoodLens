    MoodLens is part of a Learning project by me, exploring the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning. The detection accuracy of my model may vary based on the complexity of the images. The reason behined this is that the model was trained on a limited dataset (approx 200 images of both class) and may not generalize well to all images but it works to an great extent and validation accuracy is 96% and model accuracy after training is 100%
